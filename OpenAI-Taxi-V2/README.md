- monitor.py: The interact function tests how well the agent learns from interaction with the environment.
- main.py: main program to check the performance of the agent

## Result
OpenAI Gym defines "solving" this task as getting an average return of 9.7 over 100 consecutive trials, at least an average return of at least 9.1 over 100 consecutive trials (best_avg_reward > 9.1).
